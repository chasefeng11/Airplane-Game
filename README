PROJECT OVERVIEW: An Airplane Flying Game in Java
AUTHORS: Chase Feng, Matt Sadowski, Dillon Bardhi
DATE: June 2020

DESCRIPTION:
A desktop Super-Mario like computer-game in pure Java, using AWT and Swing. The program uses various container classes to
simulate (possibly moving) physical objects, and a 2D coordinate system to detect/implement collisions. High scores are
tracked by reading/writing to scores.txt.
To execute the program, users should compile and run the Menu.java program.

GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS:
Users can play by compiling and running Menu.java. 
Use up and down arrows to go up and down
Hit the spacebar to drop bombs on enemy bases and factories
Dodge enemy bullets and destroy their bases!
Your success as a bomber will be measured by your score.
Hitting enemy bases and factories will increase your score,
and staying alive for longer will also increase your score
and hitting civilian homes will decrease your score.
